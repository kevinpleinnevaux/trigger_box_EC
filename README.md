# trigger_box_EC
## General Description
### The EEG Dual Audio Trigger Box (shown below) detects if either of the two audio inputs rises suddenly by more than a certain voltage step, generating a pulse on the corresponding trigger outputs, which are then fed into the corresponding trigger inputs of a Biosemi EEG system. Two LED indicators are lit for as long as the trigger output pulse for the corresponding channel is on (1 and 2 correspond to the left and right audio channels, respectively).
